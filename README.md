# clojure-unkoaned

4clojure and the Koans are pedagogically outstanding but I found it even more effective to rework the problems/solutions into a simpler cheatsheet-style format.

After completing the problems I rearranged them as a series of input/output expressions just as they would occur in the REPL.

An ideal reference for teaching Clojure.
