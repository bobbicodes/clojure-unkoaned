# clojure-unkoaned
An astonishingly simple path to learn programming fundamentals.

I'm a huge fan of the Clojure Koans' incremental approach to learning the language, but not so much of the style of presentation. It shows you each problem in the form of an expression that you have to complete so that it will evaluate to true, which sounds simple enough but then what you end up looking at is an expression that is made up of both the problem (to be input) and the solution (the program's output) mashed together with an equals sign.

This presents the novice with too much new stuff. When exploring a new language, what I want to be getting familiar with is:
a. What a valid input expression looks like;
b. What the output will be;
and
c. Why.

Instead of being able to begin experiencing the dynamic of the programmer/interpreter relationship, instead I am faced with the task of figuring out which is which, and dealing with that. It just feels... twisted.

This is why I have taken the collection of problems and solutions and rearranged them as they would occur in a REPL, as a series of input/output relationships.

This has helped me tremendously in my learning, and I hope it will for you too..
Enjoy!
