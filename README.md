# clojure-unkoaned

I'm a huge fan of the Clojure Koans' incremental approach to learning the language, but not so much of the style of presentation. It shows you each problem in the form of an expression that you have to complete so that it will evaluate to true.

But I don't want to fill in the blanks, I just want to see how the language works. I just want to see:

a. What a valid input expression looks like;

b. What the output will be.

The task of the student/teacher is then to describe the path from a to b.

So I took the completed problems/solutions and rearranged them as they would occur in a REPL, as a series of input/output relationships.

It serves as an ideal cheatsheet or guide for teaching Clojure.
