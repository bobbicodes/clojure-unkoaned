UnKoaned 1. Equality

We shall contemplate truth by testing reality, via equality

user=> (= true true)
true

To understand reality, we must compare our expectations against reality

user=> (+ 1 1)
2

You can test equality of many things

user=> (= (+ 3 4) 7 (+ 2 5))
true

But you may not string yourself along

user=> (= 2 "2")
false

Something is not equal to nothing

user=> (= true (not (= 1 nil)))
true

Strings, and keywords, and symbols: oh my!

user=> (= "foo" :foo 'foo)
false

Make a keyword with your keyboard

user=> (= :foo (keyword "foo"))
true

Symbolism is all around us

user=> (= 'foo (symbol "foo"))
true

When things cannot be equal, they must be different

user=> (not= :fill-in 1)
true
